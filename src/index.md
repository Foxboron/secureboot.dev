# Secure Boot

This page intends to document and collect resources for working with secure boot
on Linux devices. The goal is to make it easier for users to utilize and
navigate the tools and provide resources for people interested in developing
libraries or application that take advantage of secure boot.


The documentation is a work in progress and tools, documentations and links are
added as we go along.
